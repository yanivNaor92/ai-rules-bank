# Testing and Quality Assurance

## Testing Philosophy

Comprehensive testing ensures code reliability and facilitates safe refactoring:

### Testing Pyramid
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows
- **Focus on unit tests**: They're fast, reliable, and provide quick feedback

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Write tests before implementing functionality
- Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Keep tests simple and focused
- Use TDD for complex logic and critical functionality
- Don't force TDD for simple or exploratory code

### Writing Good Tests
- **Test behavior, not implementation**: Focus on what the code should do
- **Use descriptive test names**: Clearly state what is being tested
- **Arrange-Act-Assert pattern**: Structure tests with clear setup, execution, and verification
- **One assertion per test**: Keep tests focused and easy to debug
- **Test edge cases**: Include boundary conditions and error scenarios

### Test Organization
- **Group related tests**: Use test suites or describe blocks
- **Use setup and teardown**: Initialize and clean up test data properly
- **Avoid test interdependencies**: Each test should run independently
- **Use test data builders**: Create reusable test data generation
- **Mock external dependencies**: Isolate the code under test

### Code Coverage Guidelines
- Aim for high coverage but don't obsess over 100%
- Focus on covering critical business logic
- Use coverage reports to find untested code paths
- Don't write tests just to increase coverage metrics
- Quality of tests matters more than quantity

### Types of Testing
- **Smoke Tests**: Basic functionality verification
- **Regression Tests**: Ensure fixes don't break existing functionality
- **Performance Tests**: Verify system performance under load
- **Security Tests**: Check for vulnerabilities and security issues
- **Accessibility Tests**: Ensure applications are accessible to all users

### Testing Best Practices
- **Fast feedback**: Keep test suites running quickly
- **Reliable tests**: Eliminate flaky tests that pass/fail inconsistently
- **Maintainable tests**: Keep test code clean and well-organized
- **Test documentation**: Document complex test scenarios and data
- **Continuous testing**: Run tests automatically on code changes

### Quality Assurance Beyond Testing
- **Code reviews**: Have peers review code before merging
- **Static analysis**: Use linters and static analysis tools
- **Automated formatting**: Enforce consistent code style
- **Security scanning**: Check for known vulnerabilities
- **Dependency management**: Keep dependencies updated and secure
