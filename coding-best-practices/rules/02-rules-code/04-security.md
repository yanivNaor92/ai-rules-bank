# Security Best Practices

## Security-First Mindset

Security should be considered throughout the development process, not as an afterthought:

### Input Validation and Sanitization
- **Validate all inputs**: Never trust user input or external data
- **Use allowlists over blocklists**: Define what is allowed rather than what is forbidden
- **Sanitize data**: Clean input data before processing or storage
- **Parameterized queries**: Use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- **Escape output**: Properly escape data when rendering to prevent XSS attacks

### Authentication and Authorization
- **Strong password policies**: Enforce complexity and length requirements
- **Multi-factor authentication**: Implement MFA for sensitive operations
- **Session management**: Use secure session tokens with proper expiration
- **Principle of least privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Role-based access control**: Implement proper authorization checks

### Data Protection
- **Encrypt sensitive data**: Use strong encryption for data at rest and in transit
- **Secure key management**: Store encryption keys separately from encrypted data
- **Hash passwords**: Use strong, salted hashing algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2)
- **PII handling**: Minimize collection and secure handling of personal information
- **Data retention policies**: Implement proper data lifecycle management

### Communication Security
- **HTTPS everywhere**: Use TLS for all network communications
- **Certificate validation**: Properly validate SSL/TLS certificates
- **API security**: Implement proper authentication and rate limiting for APIs
- **CORS configuration**: Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing appropriately
- **Security headers**: Use security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options)

### Code Security Practices
- **Dependency scanning**: Regularly check for vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Static code analysis**: Use tools to identify security issues in code
- **Secrets management**: Never hardcode secrets; use secure secret management
- **Error handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
- **Logging security**: Log security events but avoid logging sensitive data

### Common Vulnerabilities to Avoid
- **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries and input validation
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Properly escape output and validate input
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: Implement CSRF tokens
- **Insecure Direct Object References**: Validate user access to resources
- **Security Misconfiguration**: Follow security hardening guidelines

### Security Testing
- **Penetration testing**: Regularly test applications for vulnerabilities
- **Security code reviews**: Include security considerations in code reviews
- **Automated security testing**: Integrate security tests into CI/CD pipelines
- **Vulnerability assessments**: Regularly assess system security posture
- **Bug bounty programs**: Consider external security testing programs

### Incident Response
- **Security monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring for security events
- **Incident response plan**: Have procedures for handling security incidents
- **Regular backups**: Maintain secure, tested backup procedures
- **Recovery procedures**: Plan for system recovery after security incidents
- **Communication plan**: Know how to communicate during security incidents
