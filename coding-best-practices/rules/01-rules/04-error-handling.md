# Error Handling and Debugging

## Error Handling Principles

Robust error handling is essential for maintainable and reliable code:

### Fail Fast and Fail Clearly
- Detect errors as early as possible in the execution flow
- Provide clear, actionable error messages
- Include relevant context information in error messages
- Avoid generic error messages like "Something went wrong"

### Error Handling Strategies
- **Validate inputs**: Check parameters and data at function boundaries
- **Use appropriate error types**: Choose specific exception types over generic ones
- **Handle errors at the right level**: Don't catch exceptions you can't meaningfully handle
- **Provide fallback behavior**: When possible, offer graceful degradation
- **Log errors appropriately**: Include enough detail for debugging without exposing sensitive data

### Exception Handling Best Practices
- Catch specific exceptions rather than using broad catch-all handlers
- Don't ignore exceptions - at minimum, log them
- Clean up resources properly using try-finally or equivalent constructs
- Re-throw exceptions when you can't handle them meaningfully
- Document what exceptions your functions can throw

### Defensive Programming
- Validate assumptions with assertions in development
- Check for null/undefined values before using them
- Validate data types and ranges for critical operations
- Use guard clauses to handle edge cases early
- Implement circuit breakers for external service calls

### Debugging Support
- Include meaningful logging at appropriate levels
- Use structured logging with consistent formats
- Add debugging information that helps trace execution flow
- Include correlation IDs for distributed systems
- Make it easy to reproduce issues in development environments

### Error Recovery
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Provide meaningful default values when appropriate
- Design systems to continue operating when non-critical components fail
- Implement health checks and monitoring
- Plan for graceful shutdown procedures

### Testing Error Conditions
- Write tests for error scenarios, not just happy paths
- Test boundary conditions and edge cases
- Verify that error messages are helpful and accurate
- Test error recovery mechanisms
- Use chaos engineering principles for distributed systems
