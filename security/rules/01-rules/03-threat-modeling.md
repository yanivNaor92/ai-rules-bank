# Threat Modeling and Risk Assessment

## Threat Modeling Process

### 1. Identify Assets
- List all valuable assets (data, systems, services)
- Categorize assets by sensitivity and criticality
- Document data flows and system boundaries
- Identify external dependencies and integrations

### 2. Identify Threats
- Use threat modeling frameworks (STRIDE, PASTA, OCTAVE)
- Consider both internal and external threats
- Think about different attack vectors
- Consider both technical and non-technical threats

### 3. Assess Vulnerabilities
- Identify potential weaknesses in design and implementation
- Consider configuration vulnerabilities
- Assess third-party component risks
- Review access controls and permissions

### 4. Evaluate Impact and Likelihood
- Assess potential business impact of threats
- Evaluate likelihood of threat occurrence
- Consider existing security controls
- Prioritize risks based on impact and likelihood

### 5. Implement Mitigations
- Design security controls to address identified risks
- Implement defense-in-depth strategies
- Create incident response plans
- Establish monitoring and detection capabilities

## Common Threat Categories

### External Threats
- Malicious actors attempting unauthorized access
- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
- Malware and ransomware
- Social engineering attacks

### Internal Threats
- Privileged user abuse
- Accidental data exposure
- Insider threats and malicious employees
- Weak authentication and authorization

### Technical Threats
- Software vulnerabilities and exploits
- Configuration errors and misconfigurations
- Weak encryption and cryptographic failures
- Network-based attacks

### Operational Threats
- Business continuity disruptions
- Supply chain attacks
- Third-party service compromises
- Regulatory compliance failures

## Risk Assessment Guidelines

### High-Risk Indicators
- Systems handling sensitive personal data
- Public-facing applications with authentication
- Systems with administrative privileges
- Critical business functions and processes

### Medium-Risk Indicators
- Internal applications with limited access
- Systems with proper access controls
- Applications with regular security updates
- Well-monitored and logged systems

### Low-Risk Indicators
- Read-only public information systems
- Properly isolated internal systems
- Systems with comprehensive security controls
- Regularly audited and tested systems
